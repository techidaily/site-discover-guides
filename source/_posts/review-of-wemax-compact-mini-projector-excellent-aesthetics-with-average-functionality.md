### Key Takeaways

* The Wemax Dice Mini Portable Projector has a sleek, stable design, making it easy to travel with and enjoy movies, gaming, or thrillers in various settings.
* The projector offers a vibrant and clear image with a wide range of projection sizes, making it suitable for movie nights and other viewing experiences.
* However, the device falls short in audio quality and has some issues with the Android TV 9.0 system, which can be solved by using external audio devices and streaming sticks.

 The [Wemax Dice Mini Portable Projector](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Projector-Keystone-Correction-Battery/dp/B086R5YWW1?tag=htg-v2-5eslf37-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228076&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F896535%2Fwemax-dice-mini-portable-projector-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) wasn't the first projector I tested, which ultimately did the device a disservice. There's a lot to like about Wemax's projector, but it stumbles in critical areas, like audio and lighting, which puts it a few pegs lower than comparable models.

 Wemax's Dice 1080p portable projector is a battery-powered display you can take on the go so long as you can supplement the two-and-a-half to three-hour battery life. It's a bit bulky while remaining stubby and easy to travel with, ensuring you can enjoy a movie in the park, some gaming in the backyard, or a thriller in your theater room.

 The projector is multi-purpose, offering HDMI and USB ports along with integrated Android TV 9.0 for access to Google's massive library of apps and streaming services, sans one surprising omission. The image is clear enough for movies, and the operating system is smooth, though it has slowdowns. Unfortunately, a dim lamp, subpar audio, and under-responsive image correction are the culprits marring an otherwise great viewing experience.

 Projecting at 1080p resolution brightened by a 700 ANSI lumens bulb, the Wemax Dice is a suitable device for a movie night under the stars, so long as you make accommodations for better audio and don't mind slow-to-respond applications and services.

##  A Design That's Fun and Functional

 It took me a while to realize what I liked about the Wemax Dice's design. It's nothing super fancy, just a rectangular box with a tan carrying strap. And yet the 6.1 x 4.92 x 6.3-inch device had a unique appeal, one that drummed up a bit of nostalgia for an age I wasn't even alive for. There's something about it that looks old-timey. It could be the tan strap against the gunmetal casing, but I find it endearing.

 Of course, it's also quite a functional design, as the shorter, wider build reduces the likelihood of tipping or getting knocked over. The distribution of all 4lbs can make it a little wobbly on the wrong tripod, but it's otherwise a thoughtful design from a team that understood this [portable projector](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-tweet-to-snap-showcase-video-posting-techniques-for-2024/) could be balanced on some questionable surfaces.

 The entire look of the projector is otherwise fairly simple. It's well-ventilated and the only ports (an HDMI, USB, 3.5 mm, and DC) are tucked toward the rear bottom so as not to ruin the clean aesthetic.

##  Visually Impressive With a Minor Hiccup

 When it comes to projectors, 1080p is more than clear enough when cast against the right surface. There are 4K models out there, but the money you'll spend for that boost in visual quality may not be the best investment. The Wemax Dice does a fantastic job of recreating the crisp visuals of my Samsung TV, especially when I'm diving into graphics-heavy gaming experiences or getting lost in a good action film.

 Compared to similar 1080p models, the Dice doesn't falter. In fact, I'd go so far as to say its projection is its shining feature. It struggles a little with darker scenes and could contrast against shades of black a little better, but anything with a lot of color is going to shine bright. However, the projector suffers in brighter rooms, and it doesn't take a lot of ambient light to wash out the projection.

###  Choose Your Distance

 The Wemax Dice has quite the range when it comes to how far it can be from the wall. The screen size itself can stretch from 60 inches at 4.9 feet away from the wall to 200 inches at over 16 feet back. And all of this is done without a significant drop in quality. There are some very minor variations as the projection gets bigger, especially if there's a bit of ambient light in the room, but it always retains a noticeably high quality. This is common among portable projectors.

 If your setup calls for it, you can also turn on the rear projection. The image will project from behind the screen, which is great for aesthetics if you don't want the projector front-and-center in the room.

###  Low-Latency Gaming

 If you're a gamer, you know a crucial element is response time. Does what's happening on the screen match up to your inputs? I've yet to experience latency issues on a portable projector, and the Wemax Dice doesn't disappoint. I always expect that barely noticeable delay when gaming on a projector, but you won't have any issues on modern consoles.

##  Middling Audio With Some Options

 Where Wemax stumbles a little is in the audio department. The Dice mini projector is equipped with dual 5W speakers compatible with [Dolby Digital Plus](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-adjusting-windows-11-settings-for-adaptive-hdr/). However, they don't produce that room-filling sound you'd expect from Dolby. I wanted a little more out of the Wemax Dice, especially since the [XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/simplifying-streaming-key-tactics-for-youtube-and-twitch-via-obs-for-2024/), which is about the same size, produces a booming, present sound that works with gaming and movies.

 The disappointing sound quality won't fully pull you out of the experience but don't expect to be blown away. For the most part, it's just kind of "okay" and will need a little help through the 3.5 mm port.

##  Android TV Stumbles a Little

![Wemax Dice projector in Android TV](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/52709190508_b0798f0896_k.jpg)

 While Android TV has been one of the best features in other portable projectors, the Wemax Dice has a few issues with the built-in Android TV 9.0\. The system is marginally slower than I'm used to, and it does take some apps a little longer to load. Some, like Hulu, also run buggier than, say, the version I'm running on my [Roku TV](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-smartphone-photography-with-iphones-hdr/).

 And speaking of apps, for whatever reason, there is no Netflix. While that may not affect you if you're not a subscriber, it feels like an oversight. Thankfully, you can connect streaming sticks to the projector via the HDMI port and stream all of your content directly from them. It's an unexpected step to have to take, considering Android TV is meant to bypass the need for such devices, but it's a good workaround.

##  Slow-to-Respond Auto-Correction

 The Wemax Dice boasts [four-point keystone correction](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-an-auto-subscription-url-for-your-channels-youtube-profile/), which helps keep images centered even when the device is angled up to 45 degrees. It's a wonderful feature for any portable projector, and while the keystone does kick in when the Wemax Dice is moved, there's a longer delay that I didn't experience with [XGIMI's models](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/master-the-nft-market-leading-generators-for-digital-masters-for-2024/).

 Even the auto-focus didn't seem to want to kick in right away, leaving the image a blur for longer than I expected. When both features do activate, they do exactly as they're intended. There just seems to be a short delay that far from hinders the experience.

 If you're not pleased with the auto-keystone correct, you can take over manually and move the four corners as needed with the remote. Being able to angle the projector makes it more compatible with a greater variety of spaces. Even if you're not working with a large theater room, you'll likely still have space to cast an image.

##  Should You Buy the Wemax Dice Mini Portable Projector?

 If you're familiar with high-end portable projectors, the [Wemax Dice Mini Projector](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Projector-Keystone-Correction-Battery/dp/B086R5YWW1?tag=htg-v2-5eslf37-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228076&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F896535%2Fwemax-dice-mini-portable-projector-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) likely won't blow your mind. If you're newer in this space, you may be more enamored by its 700 lumens, dual-5W speakers, and built-in Android TV. Despite its flaws, the mini projector does deliver several important features, such as a vibrant display and solid construction.

 I wish the keystone and auto-focus were more responsive, but they are functional and, when they do kick in, they work well to ensure you get the best viewing experience possible. Having that 45-degree forgiveness because of the keystone correction will ensure you can enjoy your portable projector even in smaller rooms. So long as you have a nearly five-foot clearance, the project should work in your space.

 The Dice's biggest issues stem from poor audio quality, which is surprising considering the use of Dolby Digital Plus, and a seemingly glitchy Android TV 9.0\. The former issue can be solved by plugging in an external audio device, though you still won't achieve that full-bodied booming sound. As for the slower Android TV implementation, a streaming stick can provide the same access to streaming services with less of a headache.

 Overall, the Wemax Dice is a great design with a few pitfalls that other portable projectors, specifically XGIMI's Halo+ and MoGo 2 Pro, do a little better. It may have a slightly better battery life, which could be a deciding factor if you're planning on traveling often with it.
