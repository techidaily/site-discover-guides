A study from Harvard University showed that Apple slowed down iPhones on purpose to force users to buy new models. Apple admitted that it slowed some old models to protect aging batteries. It's also common that iPhone experiences slow performance after updating to the latest version of iOS, or the device becomes lagging all of a sudden.

 There are a few reasons why your iPhone is slow. Perhaps it's an iOS bug, or your iPhone's internal storage gets full, or some misbehaving apps and crashes are to blame. Maybe the device simply gets old and you need to purchase a new one. There are some things you can do to [give your iPhone a speed boost](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) before replacing your device or resorting to tech support.

## How to Speed up Your Slow iPhone? 

**1\. Manage Apps on iPhone**

• Close apps

• Delete unnecessary apps

• Check for the app update

**3\. Clear Caches and Cookies**

Cookies and caches also affect devices' performance. It's a good idea to clear the history and cookies from Safari on iPhone. Tap Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data. If you want to clear cookies with the browsing history kept, go to Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data > Remove All Website Data.

**4\. Update iOS** 

The old version of the iOS isn't designed to work well with some apps you are using, and the new operating system always boosts iPhone performance. If you are using a newer model like iPhone 8 or later, consider to update to iOS 17\. However, you should be aware of the unexpected [problems of the new iOS 17](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), since some users complain that they see a slow performance on their devices after iOS update. 

**5\. Reinstall iOS**

A restore is always the last step for various iPhone errors, such as iPhone getting bricked, iPhone not turning on, iOS update problems, and more.

**7\. Replace iPhone Battery**

Apple slowed down old iPhone models with aged battery to prevent damage to devices' internal components. Some users report that battery replacement has returned performance back to normal. If you are using iPhone 6s or older that has low-capacity batteries, try to change the battery to fix a slow iPhone.
