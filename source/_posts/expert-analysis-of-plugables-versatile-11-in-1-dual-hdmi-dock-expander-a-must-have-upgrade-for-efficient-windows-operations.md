 The [Plugable 11-in-1](https://plugable.com/products/ud-4vpd) is one of the least obtrusive docking stations I’ve ever tested, in terms of both aesthetic and footprint. The top and bottom sections of the hub are encased in a glossy, metallic silver plating. The Plugable logo is stamped on the top, and four silicone stoppers take up the four corners of the bottom, which prevents the 11-in-1 from sliding around your desktop.

 The front and back sides of the dock are matte-black, and the rear is where most of the dock’s ports are located. From left to right, this includes one 5Gbps USB-A, one 10Gbps USB-A, a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port, two HDMI 2.1 connections, one PD 100W USB-C (which also acts as the host connection for your laptop), and the 20V power input. Flip to the front and you’ll find (from left to right) one 5Gbps USB-A, one PD 20W USB-C at 10Gbps, a microSD/SD card reader, and an audio input/output.

 There’s also a power button on the front end with an integrated status light behind it. When you power the dock on, you’ll see a solid-white light.

##  Features: Dual Displays and a USB Medley

 If you’re using a Lenovo, Dell, or Surface laptop as your everyday workhorse, the Plugable 11-in-1 could be a dream come true. Not only does the dock feature all the most critical inputs and outputs for fast data transfer and quick charging, but those two HDMI 2.1 display ports are where the real magic lies. If you’re scrounging for screen space, you’ll be able to output your Windows laptops’ display at up to 4K at 120Hz to [two monitors simultaneously](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/fundamental-definitions-in-virtual-narrative-art/). Want even more pixels? You’ll also be able to use a single video output to get up to 8K at 60Hz.

 Unfortunately, the Multi-Stream Transfer protocol isn’t compatible with macOS systems. So while you’ll be able to use the Plugable 11-in-1 as a MacBook dock, you’ll only be able to beam your screen to one other monitor.

 Alongside these display specs, the Plugable 11-in-1 is powered by a native USB4 controller. Dishing out up to 40Gbps to the dock’s USB-C and USB-A connections, you’ll be able to transfer files from external drives to your laptop (and vice versa) fairly quickly. I’m also a big fan of these kinds of docking stations incorporating card slots. If you’re in need of expanded storage, and don’t want to invest in a separate SSD or flash drive, the Plugable gives you the option of offloading files to SD or microSD.

##  Using the Plugable 11-in-1 Dual HDMI Docking Station: Solid Charging Capabilities, Gigantic Power Supply

![The Plugable USB4 Dual HDMI Docking Station set up with a laptop and monitor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/the-plugable-usb4-dual-hdmi-docking-station-set-up-with-a-laptop-and-monitor-3jpg_53055882888_o.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 While I wasn’t able to use the Plugable’s MST capabilities to shoot video to more than one monitor (my main computer is a late 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro), I was able to put most of the USB ports to the test. Overall, the docking station gets two thumbs up in my book, although I’d like to call out a couple of things I took issue with.

 First and foremost, the included power supply is humongous. In fact, it’s actually _taller_ than the docking station and nearly matches it in terms of wingspan. I understand that it takes lots of amperage to get that PD 100W port working at its full potential, but I’ve tested some docking stations with higher wattage outputs, and I’ve never seen a power brick this big until now.

 The Plugable can also run a little on the toasty side, and I experienced some warm-to-the-touch sensations when the unit was just charging a couple of my devices. With minimal venting for heat dissipation, I can imagine the Plugable getting pretty hot when one or both HDMI ports are in use alongside the USB ports. That being said, I was very pleased with the charging performance of the docking station.

 With my MacBook Pro connected to the PD 100W host port (and using my MacBook’s provided TB4 cable) and no other devices connected, I was able to charge my laptop from 55 percent to 95 percent in a little over an hour. With a USB-C to Lightning cable plugged into the front-facing PD 20W port, I was also able to charge my iPhone 12 from 49 percent to 94 percent in the same amount of time (with no other devices connected).

 The Plugable also did a decent job at charging a few components at the same time, including my AirPods Pro 2 (PD 20W), a pair of Sony Bluetooth headphones (10Gbps USB-A), and a Mophie 20,000mAh [portable charger](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) (PD 100W). In this configuration, my AirPods charged the fastest, with the Sony headphones in the middle and the Mophie charger coming in dead last. Considering that the Plugable uses intelligent charging, I’m guessing it decided to top off my AirPods case first, seeing as it was connected to the second-fastest port and required the biggest charge at the time.

##  Should You Buy the Plugable 11-in-1 Dual HDMI Docking Station?

 For $200, I think the [Plugable 11-in-1 Dual HDMI Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C83ZMZG5?ref%5F=maas%5Fadg%5F4E8637F6D30A177B3B1D5888BBAF0A32%5Fafap%5Fabs&tag=htg-v2-t3sqs8e-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000454&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-11-in-1-dual-hdmi-docking-station-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is an excellent investment for Windows users and a decent idea for macOS workstations; but I may urge Apple devotees to think twice about whether they really need a dock or not. It’s not the cheapest USB4 station out there because you’re paying good money for those HDMI 2.1 ports to push 4K at 120Hz to two different screens.
